#### An Ode to the Personal Website

This website exists, I can be sure,

because you requested its

contents, and a server responded with

this unique sequence of bits.

<br />

But if I stop and ask myself

"why is this site really here?"

I cannot fathom the origin,

except perhaps [too much beer?]({{ 'assets/eric_birthday_beer.jpg' | relative_url }})

<br />

It also may be possible

this site is here because

[Lifehacker tricked me](https://lifehacker.com/5958893/why-its-worth-it-to-purchase-your-own-domain-name) into believing

owning a domain was all the buzz.

<!-- <br />

Yet the real answer may not be

quite so clean and facile.

There was a time I wanted a site

~to practice web development.~ -->

<br />

My first rendition of this site

was hosted by someone in flannel.

Their service was superb and I got

to play with my own cPanel!

<br />

But over time I found myself

tinkering with the server less and less.

It became clear that what I needed

was a static site, not [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express).

<br />

I would also be remiss to omit

the part this site once played,

in shaping my online identity

doing side projects, hoping to get paid.

<br />

But now I have a stable job and

what once was hosted here

has been moved to a wide range of profiles

in the [inter]-[blog]-[web]-[sphere].

<!-- <br />

As I make this shift to static site

(hosted with love by Github)

It makes me contemplate why at all

~I keep the site online~ -->

<br />

I no longer want to host a blog,

or code, or my resume,

and I cannot help but think I may

deprecate it all one day.

<br />

For the present, if you want,

you can catch a (small) glimpse of the past.

Checkout commit [4f8dc36](https://github.com/ericyd/ericyd.github.io/blob/4f8dc36550ec1d2c8e68a44071070fd74ca0fcd9/index.md)

for some songs I like to blast.

<br />

I sometimes feel guilty for hosting

a site that is just a collection of links,

but then I check out Reddit

and realize "yep, most of the internet stinks."

<br />

Though you may not know much more about me

than when you started reading,

I hope this poem offered something

to break up the day's proceedings.

<br />

I wish I could say "come back soon!"

with any sincerity,

but the truth is (yep, you already guessed)

updates here are a rarity.

<br />

So for now, I bid adieu,

and leave you on your way.

May the internet treat you well,

if not always, at least today!
