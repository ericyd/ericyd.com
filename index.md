I am a resident of Portland, OR, USA.  I recently graduated from 
<span itemprop="affiliation"
itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/EducationalOrganization">
<span itemprop="name">Portland State University</span> with a Bachelors of Science in 
<span itemprop="department">Geology</span></span>. Though I have many strengths, 
I consider myself first and foremost to be a problem solver, and I love to tinker until a solution fits.

I love food.  Pizza is perennial favorite, though summer time
tends to include a pizza hiatus due to the heat involved with cooking them.
I plan to experiment with slow cooker pizzas soon.
I loves pickles; I ferment my own (cucumbers, cauliflower, radish, kimchi, saurkraut)
and eat as wide a variety as possible.
I also love bread, whether it be pancakes, waffles, or a loaf of french bread.


I love music. I primarily love <a href="https://youtu.be/PE6HmArln_k">funk</a> (&amp; <a href="https://youtu.be/vj4TdnGMJls">funk</a> &amp; <a href="https://youtu.be/hdhxvs5v8h8">funk</a>), <a href="https://youtu.be/6Z66wVo7uNw">soul</a>, jazz, house, <a href="http://www.ektoplazm.com/free-music/auma-interactingprocessing">electro</a>, EDM, <a href="https://youtu.be/B_POkOLy2rM">folktronica</a>, <a href="https://www.jamendo.com/en/artist/338537/the-wind-whistles">folk</a>, blues, bluegrass, <a href="https://youtu.be/mS8LvHT_zcQ">rock</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/MODG8k-ZJGI">reggae</a>, but I love being turned on to new things (read: email me if you have music suggestions).  I am currently learning the bass guitar and hope to someday play along to <a href="https://youtu.be/uq-gYOrU8bA">this</a>.

I love to be outside.
I'm down with anything from yardwork to hiking to bike riding to walking along the beach.

I love Patty very much!
