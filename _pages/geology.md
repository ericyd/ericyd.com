I studied Geology in school. Here are a few photographic collections from my academic experience.

### Thin Sections

I've looked at plenty of thin sections studying geology!
Here is a collection of pictures - some much better than others.
I have labelled some of them with my interpretation of the mineral,
but I encourage people to comment directly on the images
if they have different opinions about which minerals are present.

### Southern Oregon Coast

For my sedimentation and stratigraphy class, we took a field trip to the Southern Oregon coast.
Here are some of my favorite images from that trip.
